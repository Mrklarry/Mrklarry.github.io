            <h1 class="one">"Background info"</h1>
            <p class="one">My name is Koen Larrison. I graduated from Kettering Fairmont Highschool with honors
                in 2025. After high school I plan to attend a 4-year university such as University of Dayton or Wright
                State university. I plan to major in an IT related field such as Computer engineering or counter
                science. After college I plan to go into an IT related field, leaning towards computer engineering and
                working with hardware. </p>
            <h1 class="two">“The beginning of my time”</h1>
            <p class="two">As a military kid with divorced parents my childhood has been all over the place, literally.
                Between
                moving every three or four years, and trying to coordinate an equal amount of time at each parent's
                house, my childhood was chaotic. It was almost like my life “reset” every 4 years". One big factor of
                the chaos was the constant fight for normality. Most people move maybe once or twice before they go to
                college. In total, I moved 6 times between 4 different states and watched my parents fall apart during
                these moves. The main thing I learned living this way is that life itself is inherently unpredictable.
                Sometimes it is a fight until your next paycheck, and sometimes it's moving across the country, away
                from everyone and everything you love, just to avoid living paycheck to paycheck.

            <h1 class="tre">“Modern times”</h1>
            <p class="tre">In 2020 my dad hit me with the biggest curve ball yet, I was about to have a sister. This was
                something
                that was in the air but we all thought that he was done with kids, as it had been 13 years since i was
                born. However, 2 years after remarrying he decided it was time, and I would never expect the effect this
                would have on my life. Now let's fast forward a bit; It was October of 2022 and life decided to hit me
                with something I never saw coming, literally; a car. One second I was biking to school, the next second
                I was getting someone's insurance information. While this experience sucked, it was only the start. 6
                months later, and the day after school ended, my mom gave me the bad news. We were moving, and while the
                military tried to stop forcing people to move in high school they couldn't help me. This move wasn't all
                bad, I moved in with my sister and ended up at a better high school than before. And after 2 years of
                living with my sister I've learned so much about parenting, I've learned alot about managing my
                emotions,
                and how to communicate with others.
