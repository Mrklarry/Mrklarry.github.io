            <h1>My Athletics Overview:</h1>
            <p>I have wrestled since 6th grade and have wrestled for two highschools, one of these is Gahanna lincoln
                High School, GLHS, located west of Columbus Ohio. At GLHS I wrestled for two years and was awarded two
                varsity letters, and was voted as the most improved wrestler in 2022. The other, my current school, is
                Kettering
                Fairmont High School, KFHS, located South of Dayton Ohio. I have wrestled for two years here and am on
                path to graudate with honers in May, 2025.</p>
